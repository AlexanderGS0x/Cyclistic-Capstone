# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. I analyzed bike-share data from Cyclistic (a fictional company using Divvy data) to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently, and proposed marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.

## Project Overview
- **Business Task**: Identify differences in bike usage between casual riders and annual members to design marketing strategies for converting casuals to members.
- **Data**: Divvy trip data for Q1 2019 and Q1 2020.
- **Tools**: RStudio (R Markdown for analysis and visualizations).
- **Key Findings**:
  - Casual riders take longer rides (~20-30 min) than members (~10-15 min).
  - Members ride more on weekdays (likely commuting), while casuals ride more on weekends (likely leisure).
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Offer weekend membership discounts.
  2. Run social media ads targeting frequent casual riders.
  3. Create a referral program for members.
